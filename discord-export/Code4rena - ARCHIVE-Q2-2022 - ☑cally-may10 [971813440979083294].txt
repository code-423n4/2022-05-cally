Totally agree!
Also thanks for using foundry, it's so good that it only takes 3s to run any stimulation every time, it's also  the cleanest foundry tests i've ever seen. I'm gonna copy this structure in my own project too

that means a lot. foundry is a great framework too imo. it's only the second time I've used it so most of the "good" stuff is just copy+paste from people like t11s, georgios etc. aha.

@🐺wardens The Cally contest is now closed! Huge thanks to everyone who participated 🔍, whether you submitted a finding or not.

What's next: the Cally team will review the findings over the next couple of days, and then we'll pass them off to the judge.

sorry i am new , what is the average time?


[05/17/2022 6:30 PM] ellahi
the goal is 2 weeks, but reality is >1month 🙂

C4 is currently expanding their group of judges to handle an increasing number of contests. I expect this timeline to be further streamlined in the future.


[05/17/2022 6:59 PM] 0xleastwood
I think right now there is a sort of bottleneck whenever a contest changes hands. Currently it is set up as:
 - Sponsor reviews wardens findings and disputes/disagrees with issues and attaches relevant comments.
 - Judges go through and make the decision based on information provided by the sponsor. Sometimes there is a bit of back and forth to come to a final decision. This can add some time as its all done asynchronously.
 - Judge finishes up and C4 allows for the sponsor to do a final review and double check things before awards are announced.

thankyou (2) 

[05/18/2022 6:52 PM] out.eth
Yep, we (the sponsor) have reviewed all the issues and added our comments. The judges are currently going through and doing their review now.

How is the funds distributed?

This contest is currently being judged and once that is complete and the sponsor does their final review, we will get awards calculated.

You'll get tagged if you win an award and then those are normally sent out within 1-2 weeks of the announcement on Polygon.


[06/09/2022 3:16 AM] 100proof
Is this one close?


[06/09/2022 5:02 AM] liveactionllamac4
Looks like sponsor is reviewing the preliminary judging results. If the sponsor and judge don't have much further discuss, hopefully this one can be finished up soon! 🤞
